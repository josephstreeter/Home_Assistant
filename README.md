### Manual Deployment

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Place your configuration files in the appropriate folders (see volume mappings).
3. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access Home Assistant via `http://localhost:8123`.
5. Access Zigbee2MQTT web interface via `http://localhost:8080`.

## Dashboard Access

- **Home Assistant Main UI**: `http://localhost:8123`
- **System Monitor Dashboard**: Navigate to "System Monitor" in the sidebar
- **Automation Control**: Navigate to "Automation Control" in the sidebar
- **Setup Instructions**: Navigate to "Setup Guide" in the sidebar for integration setup
- **Zigbee2MQTT Interface**: `http://localhost:8080`

## Automation Management

### Available Automations

1. **Test Sample Automation**: Sends notifications every 30 minutes for testing
2. **Evening Sunset Lighting**: Activates evening lights before sunset
3. **Morning Sunrise Lights Off**: Turns off lights after sunrise

### Control Switches

- **Auto Lights**: Enable/disable automatic lighting controls
- **Vacation Mode**: Override all automations when away
- **Guest Mode**: Modify behavior for guests
- **Sleep Mode**: Night-time automation adjustments

## Customization

- Adjust resource limits, environment variables, and volume paths as needed.
- Uncomment and configure secrets for secure deployments.
- Add or modify labels for integration with monitoring or orchestration tools.
- Customize dashboard layouts by editing YAML files in `includes/dashboards/`.
- Add new automations to `includes/automations.yaml`.
- Modify template sensors in `includes/sensors.yaml` for additional monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Check container logs for errors:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs <service>
    ```

- Ensure USB devices are accessible and mapped correctly.
- Verify network mode and port mappings if accessing services remotely.
- Check Home Assistant logs via the web interface: Settings â†’ System â†’ Logs.

### Automation Debugging

- Use the **Automation Control Dashboard** to monitor automation states
- Check template sensors for accurate counts and system metrics
- Verify input boolean states affect automation conditions correctly
- Test automations using the Home Assistant automation editor

### Dashboard Issues

- Ensure all referenced entities exist in Home Assistant
- Check YAML syntax in dashboard configuration files
- Verify template sensors are updating correctly
- Restart Home Assistant after dashboard configuration changes
