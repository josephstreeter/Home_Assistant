## Services

### 1. Home Assistant

- **Image:** `homeassistant/home-assistant:2025.1.0`
- **Purpose:** Central smart home automation platform with built-in ZHA for Zigbee device integration.
- **Volumes:**
  - `ha_data:/config/` (named volume for all runtime data and unmanaged files)
  - `./homeassistant/configuration.yaml:/config/configuration.yaml` (bind mount for main config)
  - `./homeassistant/includes:/config/includes` (bind mount for includes directory)
  - `/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro`
- **Network Mode:** Host (for device discovery and integrations).
- **Devices:**
  - `/dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0` (Zigbee USB adapter for ZHA integration)
- **Environment:**
  - `TZ`: Sets the time zone.
- **Healthcheck:** Monitors service health via HTTP.
- **Labels:** Metadata for management and automation.
- **Logging:** Rotates logs for diagnostics.

## Zigbee Integration

This setup uses **ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation)** integration built into Home Assistant for direct Zigbee device management:

- **Direct Integration**: No additional containers required for Zigbee support
- **USB Device**: Zigbee coordinator directly connected to Home Assistant container
- **Device Support**: Wide compatibility with Zigbee 3.0 devices
- **Management**: Built-in ZHA interface for device pairing and management

### Migrated from Zigbee2MQTT + Mosquitto

This configuration has been simplified by migrating from the previous Zigbee2MQTT + Mosquitto setup to the native ZHA integration, reducing complexity and container overhead while maintaining full Zigbee functionality.

## Volumes

- `ha_data` (named volume for Home Assistant runtime data)
- `./homeassistant/configuration.yaml` (bind mount for Home Assistant main config)
- `./homeassistant/includes` (bind mount for Home Assistant includes directory)

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) for automated deployment:

- **Trigger**: Automatic deployment on pushes to the main branch
- **Runner**: Self-hosted runner with Docker access
- **Process**: Copies configuration files and restarts the Docker stack
- **Verification**: Checks deployment status after completion

### Manual Deployment

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Place your configuration files in the appropriate folders (see volume mappings).
3. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access Home Assistant via `http://localhost:8123`.
5. Configure ZHA integration through Home Assistant UI: Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Add Integration â†’ ZHA.

## Dashboard Access

- **Home Assistant Main UI**: `http://localhost:8123`
- **System Monitor Dashboard**: Navigate to "System Monitor" in the sidebar
- **Automation Control**: Navigate to "Automation Control" in the sidebar
- **Setup Instructions**: Navigate to "Setup Guide" in the sidebar for integration setup
- **ZHA Integration**: Access through Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ ZHA for Zigbee device management

## Automation Management

### Available Automations

1. **Test Sample Automation**: Sends notifications every 30 minutes for testing
2. **Evening Sunset Lighting**: Activates evening lights before sunset
3. **Morning Sunrise Lights Off**: Turns off lights after sunrise

### Control Switches

- **Auto Lights**: Enable/disable automatic lighting controls
- **Vacation Mode**: Override all automations when away
- **Guest Mode**: Modify behavior for guests
- **Sleep Mode**: Night-time automation adjustments

## Customization

- Adjust resource limits, environment variables, and volume paths as needed.
- Uncomment and configure secrets for secure deployments.
- Add or modify labels for integration with monitoring or orchestration tools.
- Customize dashboard layouts by editing YAML files in `includes/dashboards/`.
- Add new automations to `includes/automations.yaml`.
- Modify template sensors in `includes/sensors.yaml` for additional monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Check container logs for errors:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs <service>
    ```

- Ensure USB devices are accessible and mapped correctly.
- Verify network mode and port mappings if accessing services remotely.
- Check Home Assistant logs via the web interface: Settings â†’ System â†’ Logs.

### Automation Debugging

- Use the **Automation Control Dashboard** to monitor automation states
- Check template sensors for accurate counts and system metrics
- Verify input boolean states affect automation conditions correctly
- Test automations using the Home Assistant automation editor

### Dashboard Issues

- Ensure all referenced entities exist in Home Assistant
- Check YAML syntax in dashboard configuration files
- Verify template sensors are updating correctly
- Restart Home Assistant after dashboard configuration changes
