# This file contains Home Assistant binary sensor entities.
# Define binary sensors here - sensors that have only two states: on/off, true/false, detected/not detected.
# Binary sensors are used for motion detection, door/window sensors, presence detection, and state monitoring.
# Use integrations like MQTT, template, or platform-specific binary sensors for various monitoring devices.
#
# Example binary sensor configuration (commented out):
#
# - platform: mqtt
#   name: "Front Door"
#   state_topic: "home/front_door/state"
#   payload_on: "OPEN"
#   payload_off: "CLOSED"
#   device_class: door
#   availability_topic: "home/front_door/availability"
#   payload_available: "online"
#   payload_not_available: "offline"
#
# - platform: template
#   sensors:
#     high_temperature_alert:
#       friendly_name: "High Temperature Alert"
#       device_class: problem
#       value_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') | float > 85 }}"
#       availability_template: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') not in ['unknown', 'unavailable'] }}"
